# OUTCOME SOURCE AND PERSISTENCE IMPLEMENTATION READINESS

**Classification:** `OUTCOME_SOURCE_AND_ADAPTATION_PERSISTENCE_FOUNDATION_V1_READY_FOR_PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTATION_AUTHORIZATION`

**Design status:** `OUTCOME_SOURCE_AND_ADAPTATION_PERSISTENCE_FOUNDATION_DESIGN_EVIDENCE_NOT_RUNTIME`; runtime `NOT_ACTIVATED`.

This is ontology, contract, and CAGT evidence only. It creates no live adapter, migration, persistence write, event consumer, queue, directive application, Product behavior, or program mutation.

The design foundation is complete and inactive. Remaining work requires Product legal/privacy/retention rulings, adapter ownership and authentication mappings, an append-only PostgreSQL migration/transaction plan, operational replay/backfill/monitoring policy, and an implemented Week owner before application.

Exact next dependency: `OWNER_AUTHORIZATION_FOR_PRODUCTION_OUTCOME_SOURCE_ADAPTERS_AND_APPEND_ONLY_PERSISTENCE_IMPLEMENTATION`.

After that: `PRODUCTION_WEEK_PLANNER_AND_WEEK_ALLOCATION_COMPOSER_AUTHORIZATION`, then `ADAPTATION_APPLICATION_ORCHESTRATION_V1_AUTHORIZATION`.

## Production Outcome Source Persistence V1

- Status: `PRODUCTION_OUTCOME_SOURCE_ADAPTERS_AND_APPEND_ONLY_PERSISTENCE_IMPLEMENTED_NOT_ACTIVATED`.
- Gate 11: `PRODUCTION_KERNEL_AUTHORITY` under `CAGT_EFFECTIVE_AUTHORITY_REGISTRY@8.0.0`.
- Pure owner: `packages/training-engine-v2`; server owner: `packages/engine`.
- Schema: 24 physical tables, 22 append-only tables, 29 indexes.
- Evidence: 180 controlled, 360 holdout, 5000 replay stress, zero semantic golden mismatches.
- Activation remains zero; existing legacy stores and `generateProgram` are unchanged.
- Next dependency: `PRODUCTION_WEEK_PLANNER_AND_WEEK_ALLOCATION_COMPOSER_AUTHORIZATION`.

## Production Week Planner And Allocation V1

PRODUCTION_WEEK_PLANNER_AND_WEEK_ALLOCATION_COMPOSER_IMPLEMENTED_NOT_ACTIVATED. The pure Planner, allocation Composer, materializer, reallocation proposal kernel,
canonical Week Policy V1, Gate 13 projection, and CAGT Registry V9 are implemented and exported but inactive.
No Product Horizon call, calendar read, persistence write, plan application, deload construction, or Product behavior is active.
Exact next dependency: `ADAPTATION_APPLICATION_ORCHESTRATION_V1_AUTHORIZATION`.

Combined fingerprint: `4f3fd80ed3fee29cb12c88ef6dea38b6e5f70777ac4718391daa8e7548527387`.
