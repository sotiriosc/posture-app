## Controlled Product Shadow Integration V1

- Status: `CONTROLLED_PRODUCT_SHADOW_INTEGRATION_V1_IMPLEMENTED_DEFAULT_OFF`.
- Classification: `CONTROLLED_PRODUCT_SHADOW_INTEGRATION_V1_READY_FOR_SEPARATE_PRODUCT_ACTIVATION_AUTHORIZATION`.
- Product decision/output authority: `LEGACY_PRODUCT_OUTPUT_ONLY`.
- V2 application state: `NOT_ACTIVATED`.
- Runtime shape: one shared successful-sync notification, two thin authenticated routes, one server service.
- Rollout: default off, dedicated internal allowlist only, no all-user/percentage/random/anonymous mode.
- Evidence: 280 controlled, 80 fixed-shell, 520 frozen holdout; fingerprint `ab127575cf878d72e5e73154936ce5991dadf148b5be847b05f5a1a94ab4226e`.
- Persistence: explicit forward-only migration plan, 9 append-only tables, no legacy Product table changes, no automatic or production migration.
- Safety: zero Product mutation, application, delivery, rendering, performed credit, or counterfactual outcome attribution.
- Remaining dependency: `SEPARATE_PRODUCT_ACTIVATION_AUTHORIZATION`.

## Controlled Product Shadow Goal and Realization Mapping V1
Chunk C adds `CONTROLLED_PRODUCT_SHADOW_GOAL_REALIZATION_PROFILE_V1_B1_B4` as an explicit, default-off, counterfactual test/replay profile. Historical Product Shadow V1 and current routes remain frozen. Product goal/context/mode, coarse experience, restricted history, equipment/load, ordered availability, preference/continuity, identity, planning-brief, pipeline, Run V1.1, and Comparison V1.1 mappings are versioned. Product UI, options, persistence, output, mutation, application, and activation remain unchanged. Next dependency: `GOAL_SPECIFIC_CONTROLLED_PRODUCT_SHADOW_EVIDENCE_V1_AUTHORIZATION`.
