# Production Final Sequencing Future Integration

Generated deterministically from the inactive production Final Session Sequencing kernel.

## Next Authorized Dependency

`POST_PRESCRIPTION_WEEK_VALIDATION_AUTHORIZATION` may consume immutable final sequence plans to validate week-level allocation, spacing, and planned exposure. It must not rewrite assignments, source events, Prescription revisions, blocks, rest, or transition truth.

## Product Activation

Activation remains a separate owner decision requiring explicit policy and resource selection, version rejection at adapters, current equipment transition facts, persistence review, observability, rollback, UI and end-to-end tests, and performance linkage. No current app, engine, Product Adapter, or `generateProgram` path calls this kernel.

## Future Evidence

PriorSessionSequenceEvidence, Product location/setup timing, actual followed order/rest/transitions, and Longitudinal response may be added only through typed versioned contracts and new locked evidence. Pairing requires separate owner policy review.

## Post-Prescription Week Validation V1

Design admission: `POST_PRESCRIPTION_WEEK_VALIDATION_V1_READY_FOR_PRODUCTION_KERNEL_IMPLEMENTATION_AUTHORIZATION`. Gate 13 authority is `POST_PRESCRIPTION_WEEK_VALIDATION_DESIGN_EVIDENCE`; Gates 14-15 remain `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` and Gate 16 remains `FOUNDATION_ONLY`. The three-ledger invariant, source-event uniqueness, final Prescription/Sequence revisions, objective provenance, contribution truth, dose-lane separation, planned stress/duration/spacing, and no-downstream-rescue behavior are admitted as design evidence only. No production validator, Week activation, app wiring, Performance ingestion, or Longitudinal behavior exists. Combined design fingerprint: `6beea85cca5cfb73343c1ae7b6705ba6a9be4a6b82c737d09945357f6563fb82`.
