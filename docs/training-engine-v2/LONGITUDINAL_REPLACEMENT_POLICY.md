# Longitudinal Replacement Policy

**Classification:** `LONGITUDINAL_ADAPTATION_GATE_16_V1_READY_FOR_PRODUCTION_KERNEL_IMPLEMENTATION_AUTHORIZATION`

**Authority:** `LONGITUDINAL_ADAPTATION_DESIGN_EVIDENCE`

**Runtime:** `LONGITUDINAL_ADAPTATION_GATE_16_DESIGN_EVIDENCE_NOT_PRODUCT_RUNTIME`; activation `NOT_ACTIVATED`.

This is test/developer evidence. It does not implement, export, activate, or wire a production Longitudinal Adaptation kernel. It does not mutate a Prescription, exercise identity, Week, phase state, or product program.

Replacement review requires an active need, repeated adverse evidence across valid completed exposures or an illegal exercise, Response Receiver replacement consideration, and Prescription review attempted/exhausted where applicable. Successful re-exposure suppresses replacement.

The only Gate 16 action is `reopen_candidate_selection_for_replacement`. Candidate Intelligence and Composer must run again; Gate 16 never selects, swaps, or bans an exercise identity.

## Production Longitudinal Adaptation Kernel V1

- Status: `PRODUCTION_LONGITUDINAL_ADAPTATION_KERNEL_IMPLEMENTED_NOT_ACTIVATED`
- Classification: `PRODUCTION_LONGITUDINAL_ADAPTATION_KERNEL_READY_FOR_OUTCOME_SOURCE_AND_APPLICATION_INTEGRATION_AUTHORIZATION`
- Activation: `NOT_ACTIVATED`
- Contract: `PRODUCTION_LONGITUDINAL_ADAPTATION_KERNEL@1.0.0`
- Policy and caller-supplied outcome sources are explicit; no live adapter or default is selected.
- Decisions remain unapplied; program, Prescription, replacement, rotation, deload, Week, and Phase mutation flags are false.
- Registry V6 records Gate 16 production-kernel authority; production code imports no CAGT registry.
- Golden equivalence: `PRODUCTION_LONGITUDINAL_ADAPTATION_GOLDEN_EQUIVALENCE_PASS` across 130 controlled, 40 shell, and 360 holdout cases.
- Stress: `PRODUCTION_LONGITUDINAL_ADAPTATION_DETERMINISTIC_STRESS_PASS` across 10000 evaluations.
- Combined fingerprint: `8827a14a2e06dc0c6ddd8902852337946babdca501c81119324b420a69917581`
