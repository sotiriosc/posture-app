# Production Week Future Integration

Status: **PRODUCTION_WEEK_PLANNER_AND_WEEK_ALLOCATION_COMPOSER_IMPLEMENTED_NOT_ACTIVATED**

Runtime activation: **NOT_ACTIVATED**


## Binding Boundary

This artifact describes a pure production Week kernel. It does not read calendars, query persistence, select exercises, prescribe dose, sequence work, apply plans, construct deloads, or activate Product behavior.

## Evidence

- Policy: `PRODUCTION_WEEK_POLICY_V1_CAUSAL_CORE@1.0.0`
- Authority: `CAGT_EFFECTIVE_AUTHORITY_REGISTRY@9.0.0`

## Adaptation Application Orchestration V1

- Status: `ADAPTATION_APPLICATION_ORCHESTRATION_V1_IMPLEMENTED_NOT_ACTIVATED`
- Activation: `NOT_ACTIVATED`
- Classification: `ADAPTATION_APPLICATION_ORCHESTRATION_V1_READY_FOR_CONTROLLED_PRODUCT_SHADOW_INTEGRATION_AUTHORIZATION`
- Contract: `ADAPTATION_APPLICATION_ORCHESTRATION@1.0.0`
- Authority: `PRODUCTION_KERNEL_AUTHORITY_NOT_PRODUCT_RUNTIME` (post-Gate 16)
- Persistence: `002_adaptation_application_orchestration_v1@1.0.0`, explicit and never automatic
- Product/app wiring: zero
- Application applied count: zero
- Combined fingerprint: `a88a493e1553badb4f8cada551ee9d8357d21c4e04872c852bc60058769f8aca`
- Exact next dependency: `CONTROLLED_PRODUCT_SHADOW_INTEGRATION_AUTHORIZATION`

The explicit server-only service can validate, build, persist, and replay unapplied shadow candidates through caller-supplied owner ports. Controlled Product shadow integration and all live Product confirmation/application remain unimplemented.

## Controlled Product Shadow Integration V1

- Status: `CONTROLLED_PRODUCT_SHADOW_INTEGRATION_V1_IMPLEMENTED_DEFAULT_OFF`.
- Classification: `CONTROLLED_PRODUCT_SHADOW_INTEGRATION_V1_READY_FOR_SEPARATE_PRODUCT_ACTIVATION_AUTHORIZATION`.
- Product decision/output authority: `LEGACY_PRODUCT_OUTPUT_ONLY`.
- V2 application state: `NOT_ACTIVATED`.
- Runtime shape: one shared successful-sync notification, two thin authenticated routes, one server service.
- Rollout: default off, dedicated internal allowlist only, no all-user/percentage/random/anonymous mode.
- Evidence: 280 controlled, 80 fixed-shell, 520 frozen holdout; fingerprint `ab127575cf878d72e5e73154936ce5991dadf148b5be847b05f5a1a94ab4226e`.
- Persistence: explicit forward-only migration plan, 9 append-only tables, no legacy Product table changes, no automatic or production migration.
- Safety: zero Product mutation, application, delivery, rendering, performed credit, or counterfactual outcome attribution.
- Remaining dependency: `SEPARATE_PRODUCT_ACTIVATION_AUTHORIZATION`.

## Supported Goal and Local-Purpose Policy V1

Chunk B3 implements explicit future-only Week Policy V2, Resolver Policy V1.1,
Prescription Policy V2, Compiler V1.2, purpose contributions, and Gate 13 V1.1.
Existing V1 behavior is frozen by reference. Product Shadow remains pinned to Compiler V1.0;
Product, UI, orchestration, persistence, and activation remain unchanged.

Evidence: [B3 implementation readiness](./SUPPORTED_GOAL_LOCAL_PURPOSE_POLICY_IMPLEMENTATION_READINESS.md)
and [canonical architecture ledger](./PRAXIS_PRODUCT_GOAL_ARCHITECTURE_LEDGER.md).

Next dependency: `EQUIPMENT_EXPERIENCE_AND_CONTEXT_SPECIFIC_PRESCRIPTION_REALIZATION_V1_AUTHORIZATION`.
